Two projects for the ML subject from the HPC&amp;BDA Master

First project is a Spark ML-lib implementation of two ML tehniques: Decision Trees and Logistic Regression for the classic Titanc survival problem <br>
The second project is a python implementation of Decision Trees done from scratch without using any external ML libs; the model was used for the Scale Problem
